Benchmarking is the process of determining the best processes, strategies, and techniques for achieving your goals.First of all, benchmarking is a completely objective process. You're evaluating data and other critical information to determine how you stack up against your competition.
By the end of your benchmarking process, you'll have discovered new ways to approach a business and set goals for the future. That's a powerful advantage over your competition.
Once you've set those goals, you can proactively pursue them.
